As of December 2019, the Gatsby community is comprised of over 2,800 contributors and tens of thousands of developers building both personal and commercial websites on Gatsby.

Open source doesnâ€™t always have the best reputation for being friendly and welcoming, and that makes us sad. **Everyone belongs in open source, and Gatsby is dedicated to making you feel welcome.**

We will never judge, condescend, or exclude anyone. Instead, we will go above and beyond to support the community, through helping you contribute to the Gatsby ecosystem, offering [free swag for contributors](https://gatsby.dev/swag), giving control to the community by [auto-inviting all contributors to the Gatsby GitHub org](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/7699#issuecomment-416665803), an open and inclusive [code of conduct](/contributing/code-of-conduct/), and other means that empower and embrace the incredible community that makes Gatsby possible.

One of our community's values is that ["you belong here"](/blog/2018-09-07-gatsby-values/#you-belong-here).

## Gatsby Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.
