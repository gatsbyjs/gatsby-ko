title: Winning Over Stakeholders
---

Any website project has multiple stakeholders, such as developers, marketers, content creators, engineering leaders, executives, and clients.

In smaller projects and organizations, one person may wear multiple hats. As a freelancer, you may be the developer, marketer, content creator, and engineering leader rolled into one. Working at a mid-sized agency or organization, you are likely to only wear one hat at a time.

When working with other stakeholders, it's important to understand their motivations so you can explain the benefits of Gatsby in a way that resonates with them.

For example, marketers typically care about increasing leads and conversion rates, executives focus on driving revenue, and clients prioritize the project shipping on time and under budget.

This section includes guides to explaining the benefits of Gatsby to the various types of stakeholders that you may work with.
