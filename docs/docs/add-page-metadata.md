title: Adding Page Metadata
---

If you've run an [audit with Lighthouse](/docs/audit-with-lighthouse/), you may have noticed a lackluster score in the "SEO" category. Let's address how you can improve that score.

Adding metadata to pages (such as a title or description) is key in helping search engines like Google understand your content, and decide when to surface it in search results.

[React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) is a package that provides a React component interface for you to manage your [document head](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head).

Gatsby's [react helmet plugin](/packages/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet/) provides drop-in support for server rendering data added with React Helmet. Using the plugin, attributes you add to React Helmet will be added to the static HTML pages that Gatsby builds.

## Using `React Helmet` and `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`

1. Install both packages:

```shell
npm install --save gatsby-plugin-react-helmet react-helmet
```

2. Add the plugin to the `plugins` array in your `gatsby-config.js` file.

```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js
{
  plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`]
}
```

3. Use `React Helmet` in your pages:

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { Helmet } from "react-helmet"

class Application extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="application">
        {/* highlight-start */}
        <Helmet>
          <meta charSet="utf-8" />
          <title>My Title</title>
          <link rel="canonical" href="http://mysite.com/example" />
        </Helmet>
        {/* highlight-end */}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
